Initial question:
Why do have to sort through various 'garbage' articles on various different sites to get updates on the games I am interested in?

    What defines a garbage article?
        merchandising (plushies, hoodies, etc)
        alternative media within the franchise (novels and movies)
        opinionated articles that do not discuss actual game changes (best class to play, etc)

As a gamer I want to be able to see, at a glance, if a game I am interested in has had any major gameplay or content updates so I can know to research it further.

    Is there another option?
        Kind of, Steam does it for games in your library but it includes blogposts and evens. I want it to be more focused on specific games you want to keep tabs on and their potential content updates.
            User adds games via twitch IGDB to keep track of, both unreleased and released.
                News api and AI pull from mentions, and exclude all of the 'garbage' articles.
                AI then organizes the information by game, and summarizes it for the user to a simple "big changes coming" type phrase and offers sources the user can go to directly.
                Non direct gameplay related articles still available on a different tab if the user wants them.
                RAG suggestions based on games the user has tracked.
                Released and unreleased news seperated on the summary page.

Recommended changes

    Add trending games based on the genres of games the user has tracked
        Agree, this keeps the suggested games relevant to the present.

    Social Features
        Was initially intending this to be a non-social thing, but there is value in being able to see what your friends are tracking and share news with them witha  single click, rather than going through discord.

        Approved
    
    Notifications
        Was intending for this to be something you just open at the start of the day, but I realized my Hawaii bias in that most game news is out 2-3 hours before I wake up. For people outside of Hawaii it probably drops after they start their day.
        Would also prove useful for friend requests.

        Approved

    Game library platform integration/auto-tracking
        I don't want the tracked list to get polluted with a massive games library, it would kind of defeat the point if you had to sift through all the games you didn't particularly care about updates for.
        A user might not want to keep tabs on all of the games they play at once.
            It will be less annoying to individually add 4-5 games you were interested in, rather than remove 50 that were auto-populated.

        Rejected
