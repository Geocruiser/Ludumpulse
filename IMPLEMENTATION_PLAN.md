## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use functional components with hooks (no classes)
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all data
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Keep files under 500 lines for AI tool compatibility
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs

### Component Architecture
- Create pure, reusable components
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add proper loading and empty states

### State Management Strategy
- Use Zustand for client-side state
- Implement TanStack Query for server state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use context sparingly, prefer prop drilling for small apps
- Implement proper state normalization

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper input validation with Zod
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Sanitize all user inputs

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Use Docker for consistent development environment
- Implement hot reloading for rapid development
- Set up environment variable management
- Create development database seeding scripts

### Production Build
- Optimize Electron app for distribution
- Implement auto-updater functionality
- Create installer packages for Windows
- Set up code signing for security
- Implement crash reporting

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Add application performance monitoring
- Implement user analytics (privacy-compliant)
- Set up error tracking and reporting
- Create usage analytics dashboard
- Implement A/B testing framework

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and fallback mechanisms
- **News Source Changes**: Create adaptable scraping system with source validation
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Electron Security**: Follow security best practices and keep dependencies updated

### Development Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP requirements, document feature requests for future
- **Performance Issues**: Regular performance audits and optimization
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Pin versions and regularly update with testing
- **Data Loss**: Implement proper backup and recovery mechanisms
